# Memory Architect - Game Design Document

## Game Overview

**Memory Architect** is a 2.5D puzzle adventure game where players take on the role of a gifted individual with the ability to enter and manipulate other people's memories. Through a combination of platforming, puzzle-solving, and narrative exploration, players help clients process trauma, recover lost memories, or solve mysteries hidden in their subconscious.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Memory Navigation
- Players control a character traversing 2.5D memory landscapes
- Side-scrolling navigation with the ability to move between different depth layers
- Jump, climb, and interact with memory objects

### Memory Manipulation
- Grab, move, and rearrange memory objects to solve puzzles
- Connect fragmented memory pieces to form complete scenes
- Clear distorted or corrupted memory elements

### Emotional Color System
- Different emotions are represented by distinct color palettes
- Players can absorb and redistribute colors to change the emotional tone of memories
- Color changes affect the environment, revealing hidden paths or objects

### Time Flow Control
- Rewind memory sequences to observe past events
- Pause time in specific areas to create platforms or passages
- Accelerate time to trigger rapid changes in the environment

### Perspective Shifting
- Switch between 2-3 parallel layers that represent different memory depths
- Some puzzles require observation from one layer but interaction from another
- Use depth perception to align objects across layers

## Visual Style

### Art Direction
- Minimalist, stylized aesthetic with clean lines and strong silhouettes
- Rich color contrasts to represent emotional states
- Lighting effects that highlight memory clarity and importance
- Blend of concrete and abstract elements depending on memory integrity

### Environment Design
- Memory scenes transform, reconstruct, or merge based on player actions
- Parallax scrolling creates depth in the 2.5D space
- Layered design allows for seamless transitions between memory depths

### Character Design
- The player character (Memory Architect) is an elegant, somewhat abstract figure
- Can emit light or change colors to influence surroundings
- Memory inhabitants change appearance based on memory clarity

## Level Design

### Structure
- Each client's memory world forms a chapter with multiple sub-levels
- Central memory hub connects to memory fragments
- New areas unlock as players repair memories

### Puzzle Types
- Visual reconstruction puzzles (rearranging fragmented memory images)
- Emotional balance puzzles (adjusting scene tone to progress)
- Perspective puzzles (switching viewpoints to find hidden paths)
- Temporal connection puzzles (linking elements from different time points)

### Progression
- Early levels teach basic mechanics through simple, clear memory scenes
- Mid-game introduces complex emotional mixing and multi-layered structures
- Late-game requires mastery of all skills to handle highly distorted traumatic memories

## Narrative

### Story Structure
- Players, as a Memory Architect, assist various clients with memory issues
- Each client has a unique backstory and memory challenge
- A deeper meta-narrative connects multiple client cases

### Storytelling Approach
- Environmental storytelling through memory scene design
- Limited dialogue for key narrative moments
- Visual symbolism and metaphor convey psychological themes

### Multiple Endings
- Player choices in memory reconstruction affect outcomes
- Some memories may be intentionally forgotten; players decide whether to restore them
- Changes to memories can have unexpected consequences

## Technical Implementation

### Target Engine
- Unity or Unreal Engine

### Key Technical Features
- Smooth layer-switching system
- Dynamic lighting effects for memory clarity changes
- Physics engine for object interaction and transformation
- Color blending system for emotional transitions

### Target Platforms
- PC and consoles as primary targets
- Potential for Nintendo Switch port
- Touch device versions would require redesigned interaction mechanisms

## Audio Design

### Sound Design Philosophy
- Atmospheric, emotion-driven soundscapes
- Subtle audio cues provide puzzle hints
- Sound effects change based on memory clarity and emotional tone

### Music Direction
- Adaptive score that responds to player actions and memory states
- Emotional themes correspond to color palettes
- Minimalist composition that builds in complexity with memory restoration

## Monetization & Release Strategy

### Business Model
- Premium indie game ($15-25 price point)
- Potential for future DLC with new client stories

### Marketing Approach
- Emphasis on unique memory manipulation concept
- Showcase distinctive visual style
- Promote emotional narrative elements
- Highlight innovative 2.5D layered interaction

### Development Phases
1. Concept validation and prototype
2. Core mechanics implementation
3. First playable level
4. Full production
5. Testing and polish
6. Release and post-launch support

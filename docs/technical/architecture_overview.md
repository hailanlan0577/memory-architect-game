# Memory Architect - Technical Architecture Overview

## Engine Selection

We have selected **Unity** as our development engine for the following reasons:

- Strong 2D and 2.5D capabilities
- Robust physics and lighting systems
- Cross-platform deployment options
- Extensive asset ecosystem
- Shader Graph for visual effects development

## Core Systems Architecture

### Memory Layer System

```
MemoryLayerManager
├── LayerController
│   ├── ForegroundLayer
│   ├── MainLayer
│   └── BackgroundLayer
├── LayerTransitionController
└── ParallaxController
```

- **LayerController**: Manages the visibility and interaction states of different memory layers
- **LayerTransitionController**: Handles smooth transitions between layers
- **ParallaxController**: Creates depth effect through differential movement rates

### Memory Manipulation System

```
MemoryManipulationManager
├── ObjectInteractionController
├── MemoryObjectFactory
├── MemoryConnectionValidator
└── TransformationController
```

- **ObjectInteractionController**: Handles grabbing, moving, and placing memory objects
- **MemoryObjectFactory**: Creates and destroys memory elements
- **MemoryConnectionValidator**: Checks for valid connections between memory fragments
- **TransformationController**: Manages object state changes

### Emotional Color System

```
EmotionalSystemManager
├── ColorPaletteLibrary
├── EmotionStateController
├── ColorAbsorptionController
└── EnvironmentResponseController
```

- **ColorPaletteLibrary**: Stores color sets for different emotional states
- **EmotionStateController**: Tracks current emotional state of memory scenes
- **ColorAbsorptionController**: Handles player absorption and emission of colors
- **EnvironmentResponseController**: Updates environment based on emotional changes

### Time Flow System

```
TimeFlowManager
├── TimelineController
├── TimeManipulationController
├── EventSequenceManager
└── TimeVisualEffectsController
```

- **TimelineController**: Tracks and manages the timeline of memory events
- **TimeManipulationController**: Handles rewind, pause, and acceleration
- **EventSequenceManager**: Triggers scripted memory events at specific times
- **TimeVisualEffectsController**: Visual feedback for time manipulation

## Rendering Pipeline

### 2.5D Rendering Approach

- Using Universal Render Pipeline (URP) with 2D extensions
- Custom sorting layers for depth management
- Orthographic camera with perspective-simulating effects
- Dynamic lighting with 2D lights and shadows

### Visual Effects Stack

- Shader Graph for custom material effects:
  - Memory distortion effects
  - Emotional color blending
  - Transparency and glow effects
- Particle systems for:
  - Memory fragment interactions
  - Layer transition effects
  - Emotional state changes

## Physics & Interaction

### Physics Implementation

- 2D physics with custom constraints for memory objects
- Trigger colliders for layer transition zones
- Raycast-based interaction system
- Custom physics for floating memory fragments

### Input System

- Input action system for keyboard, gamepad, and touch
- Context-sensitive controls that change with game state
- Adaptive accessibility options
- Camera control system for limited panning and zooming

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

- Object pooling for frequently instantiated memory particles
- Layer culling for off-screen memory elements
- LOD system for complex memory scenes
- Shader complexity management based on platform capabilities

### Memory Management

- Scene streaming for large memory landscapes
- Addressable assets for memory world components
- Memory budgeting for different target platforms
- Garbage collection optimization for smooth gameplay

## Save & Progression System

### Data Architecture

- JSON-based save data for memory states
- Player progression tracking across cases
- Memory alteration history for narrative branching
- Cloud save support for cross-platform play

## Development Tools & Pipeline

### Custom Editor Tools

- Memory scene composer for level design

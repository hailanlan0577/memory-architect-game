# Memory Architect - Prototypes

This directory contains early prototypes and proof-of-concept implementations for Memory Architect game mechanics.

## Current Prototypes

### Memory Layer Navigation

A simple prototype demonstrating the core 2.5D layer navigation system, allowing the player to switch between different depth layers of the memory world.

**Status**: Planned

### Emotional Color System

A visual prototype showing how the emotional color system affects memory environments and objects, with interactive color absorption and emission mechanics.

**Status**: Planned

### Memory Object Manipulation

A physics-based prototype for grabbing, moving, and connecting memory fragments, with feedback systems for successful connections.

**Status**: Planned

### Time Flow Control

A demonstration of the time manipulation mechanics, including rewind, pause, and acceleration effects on memory sequences.

**Status**: Planned

## How to Use

Each prototype folder contains:

- Source code
- Build instructions
- Controls documentation
- Known limitations

## Prototype Development Guidelines

1. Focus on a single mechanics or feature
2. Keep dependencies minimal
3. Include clear documentation
4. Gather feedback on usability and feel
5. Identify performance concerns early

## From Prototype to Implementation

Successful prototype elements will be integrated into the main development branch after:

1. Code review
2. Performance analysis
3. Usability testing
4. Integration planning

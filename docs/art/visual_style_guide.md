# Memory Architect - Visual Style Guide

## Art Direction Overview

**Memory Architect** adopts a distinctive 2.5D visual style that combines minimalist aesthetics with rich emotional color palettes. The visual language aims to represent the abstract nature of memories while maintaining enough concrete elements for gameplay clarity.

## Core Visual Principles

### Emotional Color Theory

- **Joy/Nostalgia**: Warm golden yellows and soft ambers
- **Sadness/Melancholy**: Cool blues and teals
- **Anger/Trauma**: Deep reds and oranges
- **Fear/Anxiety**: Sharp purples and greens
- **Clarity/Truth**: Pure white highlights
- **Forgotten/Suppressed**: Desaturated grays and blacks

### Layer Distinction

- **Foreground**: Crisp, detailed elements with stronger colors
- **Middle ground**: Main action layer with balanced detail and color
- **Background**: Ethereal, abstracted elements with softer focus
- **Layer transitions**: Subtle particle effects and color shifts

### Memory State Visualization

- **Clear Memories**: Sharp outlines, detailed textures, stable forms
- **Fragmented Memories**: Broken elements, displaced fragments, flickering
- **Distorted Memories**: Warped perspectives, bleeding colors, unstable forms
- **Forgotten Memories**: Faded edges, low contrast, incomplete shapes

## Environment Design

### Memory Landscapes

- Surreal compositions that blend realistic and impossible architecture
- Floating elements representing disconnected memory fragments
- Perspective shifts that defy normal spatial rules
- Memory boundaries dissolve into abstract void or particle effects

### Environmental Storytelling

- Key memory objects highlighted with subtle glow or color emphasis
- Symbolic elements repeated across different memories to show connections
- Environmental changes reflect emotional state shifts (blooming/withering, expansion/contraction)

### Weather & Atmospheric Effects

- **Clarity**: Clear skies, soft directional light
- **Confusion**: Fog, diffused lighting
- **Emotional Intensity**: Rain, dramatic lighting contrasts
- **Time Passage**: Accelerated day/night cycles, seasonal shifts

## Character Design

### The Memory Architect (Player Character)

- Minimalist humanoid silhouette with luminous qualities
- Ability to absorb and emit colored light representing emotions
- Subtle trailing effects when moving between layers
- Adaptive appearance that reflects current memory environment

### Memory Inhabitants

- Characters within memories have detail levels corresponding to memory clarity
- Important figures more detailed than peripheral characters
- Forgotten or suppressed figures appear as shadows or outlines
- Character expressions and poses emphasize emotional states

## UI/UX Design

### Minimalist Interface

- Non-intrusive UI elements that blend with the art style
- Emotional state indicators using the established color system
- Memory layer navigation controls with visual depth cues
- Interactive elements highlighted with subtle animation

### Interactive Elements

- Manipulable objects pulse gently to indicate interaction points
- Color-coded interaction cues match required emotional energy
- Physics-based movement and momentum for memory objects
- Visual feedback for successful connections or transformations

## Animation Principles

### Character Movement

- Fluid, graceful movements for the Memory Architect
- Weight and physicality appropriate to emotional states
- Transitional animations when shifting between layers
- Subtle idle animations that respond to environment

### Environment Animation

- Gentle constant motion in memory elements (floating, pulsing)
- Dynamic transformations when memories are manipulated
- Particle systems for memory degradation or healing
- Smooth transitions between emotional color states

## Technical Art Considerations

### Lighting System

- Dynamic lighting that responds to emotional changes
- Rim lighting to emphasize important elements
- Global illumination for cohesive memory spaces
- Light shafts to guide player attention

### Shader Effects

- Custom shaders for memory distortion and clarity
- Transition effects between memory layers
- Emotional color blending and interpolation
- Outline shaders for interactive elements

### Optimization Guidelines

- Simplified geometry with strong silhouettes
- Smart texture atlasing for memory elements
- Level of detail scaling for memory inhabitants
- Efficient particle systems for ambient effects
